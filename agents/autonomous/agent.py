"""Autonomous Agent — tool-using LLM that loops until it has a validated model.

Unlike the rigid pipeline agents, this agent:
  1. Receives a system prompt describing the goal, budget, and available APIs
  2. Gets a rich set of tools (research, validate, estimate, submit, etc.)
  3. Decides autonomously what to do each turn — research, generate, iterate
  4. Loops until it calls ``submit`` with validated code, or time runs out

The LLM is the controller. It chooses when to research papers, query the DB,
look at the frontier, generate code, validate it, fix errors, and submit.
